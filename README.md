## Compilation Instructions
### **Prerequisites**
#### Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:
Ensure you have the correct java version and maven installed:
1. Maven (v3.9 or above)
2. Java (JDK 19 or above)

You can verify this by executing the following command

```shell
mvn --version
java --version
```
### **Running**
Run the following command to run the game
```shell
./mvnw clean javafx:run
```


## Features Implemented and Working Properly
### **Player Controls**
- User navigates menus using mouse cursor and clicks on buttons to navigate through the game.

## Modified Java Classes
### Controller.java
- Getter and setter methods for sound effect related methods such as `isBackgroundMusicOn`, `setBackgroundMusicOn`, `pauseBackgroundMusic`, `playBackgroundMusic` and `resumeBackgroundMusic` to provide controlled access to the `AudioManager` class.
- Encapsulated level transition logic in `goToLevel`. 
- Smaller, more focused methods for better readability and maintainability. For example, the `launchGame` method is focused on starting the game, leaving the background music initialization to its own method.
- `Observer pattern` utilized to manage level transitions, reducing coupling between controller and level classes.
- `Reflection` was used for dynamic instantiation of levels, making it easier to scale the game with minimal changes.
- Centralized error handling with dedicated `showAlert` method, which is used in both `launchGame` and `goToLevel` methods. This reduces duplication and improves maintainability of the code.
- Whenever error occurs, the exception is logged with e.printStackTrace() and a user-friendly alert is shown with the exception details to make debugging easier.

### LevelParent.java
- added handleProjectileCollision() method to handle projectile collision with actors.

### Enemy1.java

### Boss.java
- Added `addShieldToScene()` method to add shield to the scene.
- Added `reshuffleMovePattern` to change the movement pattern of the Boss.
- Changed the logic of creating the boss projectile
- Changed `updateShieldPosition()` method to update the shield's position to match the boss's position. 
- Added `isShieldDurationExceeded()` method to check if the shield duration has exceeded the limit.
- Added  logic to check if the boss is out of vertical bounds. If out of bounds is true, resets the vertical position of the boss (not successful).

### LevelOne.java
- Added `logInitialization()` helper method to log initialization of the level.
- Added `addUserToScene()` helper method to add user to the scene.
- Added `calculateEnemiesToSpawn()` helper method 
- Added `shouldSpawnEnemy()` helper method to randomly decide if any enemy should spawn based on the probability.
- Added `generateRandomEnemyYPosition()` helper method to generate a random Y position for a new enemy.
- Added `calculateEnemiesToSpawn()` method to calculate how many enemies need to be spawned.


### LevelBoss.java (previously LevelTwo.java)
- Renamed `LevelTwo.java` to `LevelBoss.java`.

### LevelViewLevelBoss.java (previously LevelViewLevelTwo.java)
- Renamed `LevelViewLevelTwo.java` to `LevelViewLevelBoss.java`.
- 

### Projectile.java
- Added `health` variable to store the health value of the projectile. 
- If `healthAtZero()` is true, the projectile is destroyed.
- `Projectile` is destroyable by user.



### EnemyProjectile.java
- Added `health` variable to store the health value of the projectile. 
- `EnemyProjectile` is destroyable by user.

### BossProjectile.java
- made `BossProjectile` to be destroyable by user by adding health value.

### EnemyRocketProjectile.java (previously EnemyProjectile.java)
- Renamed `EnemyProjectile.java` to `EnemyRocketProjectile.java`.

### Enemy1.java (previously EnemyPlane.java)
- Renamed `EnemyPlane.java` to `Enemy1.java`.
